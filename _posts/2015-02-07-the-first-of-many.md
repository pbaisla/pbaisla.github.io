Hi. My name is Prashant Baisla and this is my first blog post. I've been meaning to start blogging for quite a long while and now I've finally done it. *Hurray!* I can finally cross this off my todo list now.

I'm planning to write posts at least once a week. I'll be blogging about anything related to computers and programming because that's what I do. In this post though, I'll just be introducing myself. 

*Let the introduction begin!*

My name is Prashant Baisla, but you already know that. What you don't know is that I am a Linux user and I've spent most of my life living in different places around the world. I love reading books and like to think a lot. I also enjoy building cool things and am a firm believer of the open source way.

I can't think of anything more to say. You'll learn much more about me than I can tell you in this post by just following this blog or having a chat with me. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/prashant7b), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/magicprashant), [Google+](https://google.com/+PrashantBaisla) and [GitHub](https://github.com/pbaisla). Feel free to send me a message if you would like to have a word.
