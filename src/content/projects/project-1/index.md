## What is it?
This atlas seeks to re-examine and understand our relationship with water — not simply as a natural resource or a problem to be managed, but as a life-giving source, and a connector of people and of communities.
It is an imaginative, interactive, and collaborative project that re-envisions the role of water in shaping the present and future of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), and the GTHA’s relationship with its rivers, creeks, and waterways.

This project is an invitation to critique, speculate, and create.
It asks: How do we think differently about water?
What if we embraced water as a connector of communities, not just a resource to be controlled?
What would Toronto look like if we opened up our buried rivers, expanded our blue-green spaces, or designed our neighborhoods to adapt to rising water?

Through this project, artists, scientists, academics, environmental activists, and community members will have the chance to speculate, reimagine, and create an atlas that not only captures diverse water-related futures of Toronto but also critiques present urban policies, design practices, and environmental priorities.

## My role
I build and manage the website for the project as a volunteer.
